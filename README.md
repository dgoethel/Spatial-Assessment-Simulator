Repository for generalized, spatially explicit simulation-estimation framework used to test the robustness of various assessment parametrizations to underlying spatial population structure and connectivity dynamics.

This is part of the Spatial Processes and Stock Assessment Methods (SPASAM) framework (see https://github.com/KateBoz/SPASAM and https://github.com/dgoethel/tag-integrated-model).

These are the model files used as the basis for the Fish and Fisheries paper:
